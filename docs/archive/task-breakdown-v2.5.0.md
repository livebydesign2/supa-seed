- ✅ Configuration layers compose correctly without conflicts
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained with v2.4.0

#### Task 8.3: Performance and Scalability Testing
**Priority**: P1
**Estimated Effort**: 3 days

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create performance benchmarks for new features
   - Detection engine performance benchmarking
   - Extension system performance impact analysis
   - Archetype generation performance testing
2. Add scalability testing for complex scenarios
   - Large schema detection performance
   - Multiple extension simultaneous loading
   - High-volume archetype generation testing
3. Create performance regression testing
   - v2.4.0 performance comparison
   - Memory usage and optimization validation
   - CLI command performance benchmarking

**Files to Create**:
- `src/__tests__/performance/detection-performance.test.ts`
- `src/__tests__/performance/extension-performance.test.ts`
- `src/__tests__/performance/archetype-performance.test.ts`

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Detection engines perform within acceptable time limits
- ✅ Extension system adds minimal performance overhead
- ✅ Archetype generation scales appropriately
- ✅ No performance regression from v2.4.0

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Detection Accuracy**: Platform and domain detection algorithms may have edge cases
2. **Extension Compatibility**: Multiple extensions may conflict or interfere
3. **Configuration Complexity**: Layered configuration may become too complex
4. **Performance Impact**: New features may significantly impact seeding performance

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Detection Validation**: Extensive testing with diverse MakerKit schemas and manual validation
2. **Extension Testing**: Comprehensive extension compatibility testing and conflict resolution
3. **Configuration Simplification**: Maintain simple defaults while providing advanced options
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance benchmarking throughout development

## Success Criteria Summary
