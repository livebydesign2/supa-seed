## 🔍 Questions for Beta User

Before we commit the bug fixes to git, we need additional information to ensure our fixes are comprehensive and we don't miss any edge cases:

### **1. Environment Details**
- What **Node.js version** are you running? (The error logs might help identify version-specific issues)
- Are you using **pnpm**, **npm**, or **yarn** for package management?
- What **Supabase CLI version** are you using? (`supabase --version`)

### **2. Schema Verification**
- Can you run `supabase db reset --no-seed` and then **immediately** run our enhanced detect command with: 
  ```bash
  npx supa-seed detect --verbose --url "http://127.0.0.1:54321" --key "[SERVICE_KEY]"
  ```
- Does the **exact same issue** occur, or do you see improved detection now?

### **3. Configuration Context**
- Can you share your **current `supa-seed.config.json`** file (with sensitive keys redacted)?
- Do you have any **custom environment variables** set that might affect detection?
- Are you using any **custom schema naming conventions** or **prefixed table names**?

### **4. Edge Cases to Test**
- Does the issue persist if you **delete the config file** and run detection fresh?
- What happens if you run detection **immediately after** a successful `supabase start`?
- Have you tried detection with different **service role keys** (anon vs service_role)?

### **5. MakerKit Specifics**
- Which **exact MakerKit template/version** are you using? (This helps us verify our detection patterns match)
- Are you using the **standard MakerKit migrations** or custom ones?
- Do you have any **custom tables** that extend beyond standard MakerKit schema?

### **6. Success Criteria**
- What would a **"perfect" detection output** look like for your use case?
- Are there specific **table relationships** or **data patterns** that are critical for your seeding workflow?

## 🧪 Quick Test Request

Could you run this quick verification sequence:

```bash
# 1. Test current state with enhanced detection
npx supa-seed detect --verbose --debug

# 2. Test with explicit config override
echo '{"database":{"framework":"makerkit-v2"}}' > temp-config.json
npx supa-seed detect --verbose --debug

# 3. Check table existence manually in database
psql postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres -c "\dt"

# 4. Clean up test file
rm temp-config.json
```

This will help us confirm:
- ✅ Enhanced detection is working
- ✅ Configuration overrides are respected  
- ✅ All expected tables are actually present
- ✅ No permission or connection issues

## 📋 Expected Enhanced Output

Based on our fixes, you should now see output similar to this:

```
📋 Enhanced schema detected: {
  primaryUserTable: 'accounts',
  structure: 'makerkit',
  makerkitVersion: 'v2',
  frameworkType: 'makerkit',
  customTables: 35+,
  relationships: 15+,
  assetCompatibility: {
    images: true,
    markdown: true,
    storage: 'supabase_storage'
  }
}

📊 Database Schema Analysis:
   🏗️  Framework detected: makerkit
   📦 MakerKit version: v2
   👤 Has profiles table: ✅
   👤 Has accounts table: ✅  
   📝 Has setups table: ✅
   🏷️  Has categories table: ✅
   📋 Primary user table: accounts
   🔗 Custom tables found: 8
   🔄 Relationships detected: 6
   🖼️  Image support: ✅ (supabase_storage)
```

**Instead of the previous broken output:**
```
📊 Database Schema Analysis:
   🏗️  Framework detected: custom
   👤 Has profiles table: ❌
   👤 Has accounts table: ❌  
   📝 Has setups table: ❌
   🏷️  Has categories table: ❌
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Beta User Testing**: Please run the verification commands above
2. **Report Results**: Share the output and any remaining issues
3. **Final Validation**: Confirm that seeding now works as expected
4. **Git Commit**: Once validated, we'll commit the fixes with confidence

## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

For reference, here are the key changes made:

### **1. Enhanced MakerKit Detection Logic**
- Added detection for additional MakerKit v2 tables: `role_permissions`, `billing_customers`, `gear_items`, `reviews`
- Improved version detection patterns for v1/v2/v3 classification
- Enhanced relationship and asset compatibility analysis

### **2. Configuration Override Support**
- Added support for respecting manual framework configuration
- CLI now checks existing config file for `database.framework` settings
- Prevents auto-detection override when user explicitly sets framework type

### **3. Enhanced CLI Output**
- Added `--debug` flag for detailed analysis
- Enhanced `--verbose` output with comprehensive schema information
- Displays MakerKit version, custom tables, relationships, and asset compatibility

### **4. Local Supabase Environment Support**
- Added detection for local development URLs (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `:54321`)
- Enhanced error reporting and debugging for local environments
- Improved table existence checking with better timeout handling

### **5. Type Safety and Build Fixes**
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors
- Fixed parameter passing through the detection chain
- Improved error handling and logging

Getting this feedback will ensure our commit addresses the **root cause** rather than just the symptoms, and that we haven't introduced any regressions for other MakerKit users.
